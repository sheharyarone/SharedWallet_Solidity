# SharedWallet_Solidity
This is the shared wallet smart contract where we, as owner, can manage funds ( for family, bussiness purposes, etc.).
Everybody can give funds to smart contracts but only the owner is allowed to withdraw all the funds from smart contract.
Owner will decide which user ( using ADDRESSESS) can withdrawl how much amount.
Owner can change the withdrawl limit of any user at any time.
NO body can se the withdrawl limit of any other person.
